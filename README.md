# SQL Queries using the Sakila database
------
- The purpose of this project was to run multiply queries in MySQL Workbench using the [Sakila database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/).

- The [introduction on the Sakila database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-introduction.html) states the "Sakila sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team, and is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. Sakila sample database also serves to highlight the latest features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers."

- Further documentation on the Sakila database can be found [here](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/sakila-en.pdf).
